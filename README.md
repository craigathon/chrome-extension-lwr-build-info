</div>

Easily understand what components make up a Salesforce Lighting Web Runtime live site!

When an LWR site is loaded, the extension popup can be opened. This UI will allow you to add and remove a clickable badge for each component placed by builder on the live site page. After navigating to a new page just click 'Show Build Information' within the extension popup again to add badges to new components on the page.

Clicking on a badge reveals additional information about the component. Theme and Section components display additional styling property information.
